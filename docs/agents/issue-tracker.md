# Issue tracker: GitHub

Issues and PRDs for this repo live as GitHub issues in `eedsilva/agent-foundry`. Use the `gh` CLI for all operations.

## Conventions

- **Create an issue**: `gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."`. Use a heredoc for multi-line bodies.
- **Read an issue**: `gh issue view <number> --comments`, filtering comments by `jq` and also fetching labels.
- **List issues**: `gh issue list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,comments --jq '[.[] | {number, title, body, labels: [.labels[].name], comments: [.comments[].body]}]'` with appropriate `--label` and `--state` filters.
- **Comment on an issue**: `gh issue comment <number> --body "..."`
- **Apply / remove labels**: `gh issue edit <number> --add-label "..."` / `--remove-label "..."`
- **Close**: `gh issue close <number> --comment "..."`

Infer the repo from `git remote -v` — `gh` does this automatically when run inside a clone.

## This repo's additional label taxonomy

Beyond the triage labels (see `triage-labels.md`), this repo carries a delivery taxonomy that predates these skills. Apply the relevant ones alongside the triage label:

| Prefix        | Purpose                    | Examples                                                        |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `kind:`       | Nature of the work         | `kind:feature`, `kind:bug`, `kind:architecture`, `kind:epic`      |
| `area:`       | Owning package / surface   | `area:orchestrator`, `area:executors`, `area:model-router`        |
| `priority:`   | Delivery priority          | `priority:p0` … `priority:p3`                                     |
| `track:`      | Workstream                 | `track:core`, `track:safety`, `track:ux`                          |
| `target:`     | Release target             | `target:personal-v1`, `target:hosted-v2`, `target:shared`         |
| `commitment:` | Roadmap commitment level   | `commitment:now`, `commitment:next`, `commitment:candidate`       |

Issues are also organised into **milestones** that map to roadmap versions (`v0.7` … `v1.0`, `v2.0`, plus `Delivery Foundation` and `Bugs`). Put new work in the milestone that owns it.

## Sub-issues

This repo uses GitHub's native sub-issue relationship to hang implementation tickets off a parent spec or epic:

```sh
# Get the parent's numeric database id (NOT the #number)
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/issues/<parent> --jq .id

# Attach a child
gh api --method POST repos/:owner/:repo/issues/<parent>/sub_issues -F sub_issue_id=<child-db-id>
```

## Blocking edges

Use GitHub's **native issue dependencies** — the canonical, UI-visible representation:

```sh
gh api --method POST repos/:owner/:repo/issues/<blocked>/dependencies/blocked_by -F issue_id=<blocker-db-id>
```

`<blocker-db-id>` is the blocker's numeric **database id** (`gh api repos/:owner/:repo/issues/<n> --jq .id`) — not the `#number` and not the `node_id`. GitHub reports open blockers under `issue_dependencies_summary.blocked_by`, which is the live gate. Where dependencies aren't available, fall back to a `Blocked by: #<n>, #<n>` line at the top of the body.

A ticket is unblocked when every blocker is closed.

## Pull requests as a triage surface

**PRs as a request surface: no.** _(Set to `yes` if this repo treats external PRs as feature requests; `/triage` reads this flag.)_

When set to `yes`, PRs run through the same labels and states as issues, using the `gh pr` equivalents:

- **Read a PR**: `gh pr view <number> --comments` and `gh pr diff <number>` for the diff.
- **List external PRs for triage**: `gh pr list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,author,authorAssociation,comments` then keep only `authorAssociation` of `CONTRIBUTOR`, `FIRST_TIME_CONTRIBUTOR`, or `NONE` (drop `OWNER`/`MEMBER`/`COLLABORATOR`).
- **Comment / label / close**: `gh pr comment`, `gh pr edit --add-label`/`--remove-label`, `gh pr close`.

GitHub shares one number space across issues and PRs, so a bare `#42` may be either — resolve with `gh pr view 42` and fall back to `gh issue view 42`.

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create a GitHub issue.

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

Run `gh issue view <number> --comments`.

## Wayfinding operations

Used by `/wayfinder`. The **map** is a single issue with **child** issues as tickets.

- **Map**: a single issue labelled `wayfinder:map`, holding the Notes / Decisions-so-far / Fog body. `gh issue create --label wayfinder:map`.
- **Child ticket**: an issue linked to the map as a GitHub sub-issue (see Sub-issues above). Labels: `wayfinder:<type>` (`research`/`prototype`/`grilling`/`task`). Once claimed, the ticket is assigned to the driving dev.
- **Blocking**: native issue dependencies (see Blocking edges above).
- **Frontier query**: list the map's open children, drop any with an open blocker (`issue_dependencies_summary.blocked_by > 0`) or an assignee; first in map order wins.
- **Claim**: `gh issue edit <n> --add-assignee @me` — the session's first write.
- **Resolve**: `gh issue comment <n> --body "<answer>"`, then `gh issue close <n>`, then append a context pointer to the map's Decisions-so-far.
